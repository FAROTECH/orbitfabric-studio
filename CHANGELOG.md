- Accepted `ADR-0006 — v0.1 Implementation Stack and Read-only Shell`.
- Confirmed the v0.1.0 stack: Tauri 2, React, TypeScript, Vite, Monaco Editor and controlled OrbitFabric CLI invocation.
- Deferred React Flow until graph views become part of the roadmap scope.
- Added `V0_1_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` as the release gate for the Read-only Mission Project Viewer.
- Archived the v0.0.0 completion checklist under `docs/releases/`.
- Added the first minimal Tauri 2 application scaffold.
- Added a React, TypeScript and Vite frontend scaffold.
- Added a static Studio shell screen that states the v0.1.0 boundaries.
- Added a minimal Tauri backend entrypoint.
- Added a minimal Tauri capability granting only `core:default`.

### Changed

- Updated the README status from the v0.0.0 Charter baseline to v0.1.0 development.
- Clarified that v0.1.0 is governed by the narrower `Open -> Inspect` implementation loop.
- Updated the README with initial development commands and scaffold structure.
- Updated the development notes to describe the workspace inspection slice.
- Updated Tauri capabilities to allow only the directory selection dialog in addition to the baseline core permission.

### Removed

## v0.0.0 — Studio Charter

Initial architecture-first baseline for OrbitFabric Studio.

This release does not ship an application.

It establishes the project foundation for a future visual engineering workbench around OrbitFabric Mission Data Contracts.

### Added

- Project README.
- Studio roadmap.
- Project charter.
- Vision document.
- Explicit non-goals.
- Architecture principles.
- Data boundary definition.
- UX principles.
- Risk register.
- Initial architecture decision records.
- Mockups directory policy.
- Examples directory policy.
- v0.0.0 completion checklist.
- Repository hygiene files.

### Architecture Decisions

- `ADR-0001` — Separate Repository.
- `ADR-0002` — Downstream Visual Workbench.
- `ADR-0003` — Core-delegated Validation.
- `ADR-0004` — Initial Technology Direction.
- `ADR-0005` — Read-only First, Controlled Authoring Later.

### Core Principles Established

- The Mission Model remains the source of truth.
- OrbitFabric Core remains authoritative for validation, scenario evidence and generated artifacts.
- Studio is a downstream visual engineering workbench.
- Studio may display engineering meaning but must not invent it.
- Studio is not read-only by identity.
- Studio is read-only by initial maturity strategy.
- Future authoring must be explicit, patch-based, reviewable and validation-gated.
- Generated artifacts are disposable and must remain distinguishable from source model files.
- Source model, derived report, generated output and UI state must remain separate categories.

### Non-goals Confirmed

OrbitFabric Studio is not:

- OrbitFabric Core;
- a flight software framework;
- an OBC runtime;
- a ground segment;
- a mission control system;
- a live telemetry dashboard;
- a command uplink console;
- a spacecraft simulator;
- a CCSDS/PUS/CFDP implementation;
- a Yamcs/OpenC3 replacement;
- a generic YAML IDE;
- a generic diagramming tool;
- a cloud collaboration platform.

### Implementation

No application code is included.

No frontend scaffold is included.

No Tauri, React, TypeScript or package manager setup is included.

The initial technology direction is documented but not yet committed as implementation.

### Release Type

Documentation-only.

Architecture-first.

Boundary-first.

Charter release.
